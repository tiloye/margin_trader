MarginTrader is a Python-based backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies. It allows traders to test their strategies on historical data and analyse the performance with various metrics. The framework primarily supports CFD trading, enabling the simulation of trading scenarios with leverage to potentially increase returns.

[QuantStart's](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I/) event-driven backtesting series serves as the foundation for this project.
